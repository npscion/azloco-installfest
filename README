/***
* Purpose *
***/

Historically, Installfest logs and attendence have been recorded on paper. Ideally, this paper would be cataloged digitally. Realistically, this is a time consuming, manual process that seldom occurs. As a result, there is a lot of useful data that is being recorded and lost.

Proposal: build a web app, connect it to a searchable database, and give access to this on the azloco server. This puts information from past Installfests at your fingertips, easily accessible from any internet connected device.

/***
* Prerequisites *
***/

You will need a web server set up locally to use this. I'm using Debian 8, Nginx 1.6.2, PHP 5.5 and MySQL 5.6 on my local environment. You will also need git and curl installed to setup the enviroment.

/***
* Installation *
***/

From a terminal, make sure you are in the directory that you have proper permissions for and want the project. Then run the following:

git clone https://github.com/npscion/azloco-installfest.git
sudo chmod -R 777 azloco-installfest
cd azloco-installfest
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- && ./composer.phar install --prefer-dist

/***
* SQL Database *
